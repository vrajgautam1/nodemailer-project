- no need for a circular reference in users and address table. 
at first i thought that user must have id of the address in the address table 
and address must have id of the user in the user table. 
but no for users just say that it is associated to the address table in a hasOne relation
and for address just keep a foreignKey as userId 
so yeah no column for address in the address table.

this is somewhat a concept of normalization (will learn more on that in the future)

- when it comes to having system generated passwords and keeping some fields to be empty.
in the model we should always keep allowNull as true otherwise it will always throw an error. 
apart from that, to make changes in the table we must use changeColumn("tablename", "columnname", {
    whatever changes are here
})

- when it comes to having default values. we must use  the word "defaultValue" instead of "default"

since nodemailer's function was IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)

Itâ€™s a JavaScript function that runs automatically as soon as it is defined, without needing to be called manually later.
